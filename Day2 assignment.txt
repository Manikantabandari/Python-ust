DAY 2
1.why we cannot call local variable from out side of function?
2.where do we use filter map() and reduce() 

1. We cannot call a local variable from outside a function because of scope rules in programming
A local variable is created inside a function and exsits only during the execution of that function
Outside the function the variable is out of scope so the program cannot access it

def show()
    x=10
    print(x)
show()
print(x)

x is a local variable inside the function show()
outside the function x does not exist so python raise a Name error

2. filter()
used to select elements from a sequence based on a condition.
nums = [1,2,3,4]
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))

map()
used to apply an operation to each element of a sequence
nums = [1,2,3,4]
squares = list(map(lambda x: x*x, nums))
